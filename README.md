# Digital Logic Lab Projects (CSC 244L)

A comprehensive series of laboratory projects implementing fundamental computer architecture concepts in SystemVerilog using DE10-Lite FPGA boards.

## Project Overview

This collection consists of 6 hands-on laboratory projects covering essential digital logic concepts:

1. **Lab 1: Digital Logic & DeMorgan's Law**
   - Rise/fall time analysis using oscilloscope
   - Implementation of DeMorgan's theorems
   - First introduction to Quartus and FPGA programming

2. **Lab 2: Logic Simplification & Implementation**
   - Boolean algebra simplification
   - Sum-of-Products (SOP) and Product-of-Sums (POS) implementations
   - Verification using NAND and NOR gates

3. **Lab 3: Combinational Building Blocks**
   - Multi-module project structure
   - Active high/low signal conventions
   - Seven-segment display implementation

4. **Lab 4: Sequential Circuits**
   - Implementation of various latches and flip-flops
   - Input debouncing techniques
   - Hierarchical SystemVerilog module design

5. **Lab 5: Finite State Machines**
   - Moore and Mealy FSM implementations
   - Sequence detector design
   - FSM behavior verification

6. **Lab 6: Binary Arithmetic**
   - 2's complement arithmetic
   - Adder/subtractor circuit design
   - Binary-to-decimal conversion

## Technical Requirements

- DE10-Lite FPGA Board
- Quartus Prime Lite Edition
- SystemVerilog
- Basic breadboarding components

## Project Structure

Each lab contains:
- Pre-lab preparation requirements
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Testing and verification procedures
- Documentation requirements

## Documentation

Each project includes detailed circuit diagrams, truth tables, and SystemVerilog code implementations. Students must submit separate modules with proper file organization:
- One .txt file per SystemVerilog module
- Clear module naming conventions
- Comprehensive input/output documentation
- Circuit/block diagrams where applicable

## Assessment

Projects are evaluated based on:
- Pre-lab completion
- In-lab demonstration
- Code quality and documentation
- Circuit implementation
- Functional verification
